Here is the front page for my website. Woohoo!


I have procrastinated on making a portfolio/blog website for far too long.
A large part of this procrastination was a result of not knowing what I
was doing, and not really knowing where to start. I'm going to try and
take this one step at a time. Right now, this website is just Markdown
files and Eleventy. I'll continuously work on improving this over time.


My name is Will Kibel. I make music, write, and work on video games.
I'm currently a marketing intern at Akupara Games, and have previously
worked in IT. I have a wide variety of skills, and I've gotten very good
at applying them in a wide variety of ways. Web dev is not yet one of those
skills, but I'm working on it.

Stay tuned.
