<p>Here is the front page for my website. Woohoo!</p>
<p>If you've somehow stumbled upon this website while this message is still present, it is very much still a work in progress. This website uses the Eleventy framework, but because of my lack of web prowess, it's mostly just HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>My name is Will Kibel. I make music, write, and work on video games.
I'm currently a marketing intern at Akupara Games, and have previously
worked in IT. I have a wide variety of skills, and I've gotten very good
at applying them in a wide variety of ways. Web dev is not yet one of those
skills, but I'm working on it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
