<p>Here is the front page for my website. Woohoo!</p>
<p>If you've somehow stumbled upon this website while this message is still present, it is very much still a work in progress. This website uses the Eleventy framework, but because of my lack of web prowess, it's mostly just plain HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>My name is Will Kibel. I'm currently a third-year student at Northeastern University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Game Development. I make music, write, and work on video games. I'm currently a marketing intern at Akupara Games, and have previously worked in IT and as an office assistant at Northeastern.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out the best way to organize this site. I want it to function as a showcase of my music, my games, my marketing work, my writing, and as a general blog/space to dump my every thought into. I don't know the best way to organize that so that both potential employers and myself enjoy it. It's gonna be a learning process.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
