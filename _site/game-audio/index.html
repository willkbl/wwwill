I've been doing sound design and music for games for about 5 years now, and have been doing both sound design and music in general for much, much longer. Below you can see some of the projects I've worked on in the game audio space. I pride myself on my versatility as a composer and a sound designer, so there's a wide variety of things to see.</p>
<p>
    While both the <a href="/games/index.html" target="_self">games</a> and <a href="/music/index.html" target="_self">music</a> pages of this site contain elements of my game audio work, I wanted to make a separate space here to showcase it in a more focused manner (and also include some other pieces of work).
</p>
<p>In addition, while all of my music is representative of my skills as a musician, the stuff on this page is specifically focused towards design for games. If you'd like a more full account of my skills or want to see something specific, please reach out to me! I'm always happy to discuss my work or provide something further.</p>

<p>For my midterm project in my Music &amp; Audio for Video Games class at Northeastern (with Prof. Chel Wong), I took this 30-second clip of gameplay from Strange Scaffold's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a> and redid the audio from scratch. Everything you hear in this video, from music to sound effects to dialogue, was designed and created by me in the span of a week or so. This redesign received support from some of the game's developers on Twitter.</p>

<p>This short 3-track EP was another assignment for my game audio class. We were tasked with making an adaptive, dynamic soundtrack featuring 3 versions of the same song that could (theoretically) be seamlessly switched between in gameplay, with each song sharing the same tune and structure. I've tested it in my DAW, and it works!</p>
<p>While there is no actual game (yet) to support this soundtrack, I wrote and produced it based on the idea of a time-hopping spaceship shoot-em-up. The first track, Spaceship Dogfight 19XX, would be an earlier time period, while the second, Spaceship Dogfight 20XX, would be later. The third track, In-Flight Repairs, would play while you are upgrading or repairing your ship, on the fly.</p>
<p>This project was also released as an EP on streaming services. You can listen to it on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7ch74VjUiZyZKSzO7PquQw?si=967372b6b827490e">Spotify</a> or any other platform of your choice. Perhaps I'll turn this idea into a full game someday.</p>

<p>Move/Shoot is a game I worked on for the Ludum Dare Game Jam in October 2023. I composed all the music and did all of the sound design, as well as doing some of the programming. This whole game was made in 2 days by a team of 5 people.</p>
<p>The song was written to loop perfectly (as game audio does). It's about 2 minutes and 30 seconds long, which means this video is too short to play the looping part. Oops! I also wish the menu music was played for longer, it's a jam.</p>

<h4>id Tech - doom/wolfenstein inspired song (with gameplay video)</h4>
<p> </p>
<h4>Thundersong - ror2 inspired song (with gameplay video)</h4>
<p> </p>
<h4>Source Engine - hl2 inspired song (with gameplay video)</h4>
<p> </p>
<h4>MORE FULL AUDIO CONVERSIONS (but oops I have to actually do them first)</h4>
<p>also i have to consider the order of things but I can deal with that once everything is actually in</p>
