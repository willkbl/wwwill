				<h4>hoverbikes</h4>
<h5>12/20/25</h5>
<p>Trains emerge from the concrete pillars, stretching over the countryside and into the waves, orange and turquoise streaks fading into some unknown future.</p>
<p>The year is 2056. They have drained the color from the ocean.</p>
<p>The year is 2056. The trains run long, near infinite. The tracks are rusty. The world is groaning.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dani knows her hoverboard like a new friend. She runs her fingers over its edge, the curved, polished plastic thrumming, the rhythmic feedback of the repulsors. It’s textured, yet smooth. Calculated pockmarks, not an acne but a deliberate collection of miniature craters. Not scars, but points on a constellation.</p>
<p>Some hoverboards are quiet. Not Dani’s. Her board sputters and growls.</p>
<p>She is seated on a hard, concrete bench outside a courthouse. The sun is hidden behind a skyscraper. Long, dim shadows pattern the road in front of her, which little vehicles scuttle across aimlessly.</p>
<p>The board rests upright, repulsors only doing enough work to keep it vertical. Dani lays a hand on it gently, keeping it stationary in as unrestrictive a way as possible. She spins it, aimlessly.</p>
<p>The streetlight beep in sequence. They didn’t use to make noise, but changing traffic laws and the prevalence of open-air transportation has resulted in climbing accident rates, making it a statistical necessity.</p>
