<p>Still need to check whether or not the name &quot;wwwill.org&quot; is taken. Surely it is.</p>
<p>I'm working on web development to create a website for myself. The site should have three main features: a place to showcase my games, a place to showcase my music, and a blog. I may add more features if I feel ambitious.</p>
<p>I'm using Eleventy as a framework to generate the site. All other content is my own, unless otherwise specified.</p>
