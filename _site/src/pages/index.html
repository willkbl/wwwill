<h1>Will Kibel</h1>
<p>Welcome to Will Kibel's website.</p>
<p>This website is a WORK IN PROGRESS. More updates will be coming soon.</p>
<h3>How it's going so far</h3>
<p>Web dev is a daunting thing to get into. I have little to no experience with it right now, and I worry about whether I'll be able to get this project off the ground or not. I'm not exactly a great developer, but I'm hopeful that if I commit to it, I can get this project up and running, and not just have a functional website but <em>understand</em> how I got there in the first place.</p>
<p>I'm starting slow, just trying to learn the basics of how Markdown works (not that it's all that involved, but it's still something I need to get used to).</p>
<p>My next step, I think, is twofold - get CSS working (so the site looks nicer), and get links working (so I can have multiple pages and navigate through them). Those are both top priorities right now.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how the formatting is going to work<br>
with CSS and everything, but for now I suppose<br>
I can just try to make things aligned right myself</p>
