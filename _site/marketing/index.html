One of my areas of specialty is marketing, with a focus in copywriting and social media management. I spent 6 months as a Marketing Intern at <a href="https://www.akuparagames.com/">Akupara Games</a>, as well as a year as the Head of Marketing for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shakespearenu">Northeastern Shakespeare Society</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what I've done:</p>
<h4>Akupara Games - Marketing Intern (June - December 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Managed 4 social media accounts, both broad company accounts and accounts for specific games</li>
<li>Wrote copy for over 200 posts for 12+ different games from the Akupara catalog</li>
<li>Coordinated synchronized posts across multiple platforms (Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, GameJolt and Threads)</li>
<li>Spearheaded multiple social media initiatives, including takeovers, shoutouts, video clips, and content calendars</li>
<li>Created assets for use for social media promotion</li>
<li>Credited on several Akupara-published games, including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/"><em>Rain World</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2522120/Airframe_Ultra/"><em>Airframe Ultra</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885930/GIGASWORD/"><em>GIGASWORD</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184080/Echo_Weaver/"><em>Echo Weaver</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141630/Montabi/"><em>Montabi</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851720/Dead_Pets_Unleashed/"><em>Dead Pets Unleashed</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525890/Future_Vibe_Check/"><em>Future Vibe Check</em></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Northeastern Shakespeare Society (April 2024 - April 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Upheld our social media accounts/links and helped facilitate auditions, signups, and events</li>
<li>Made graphics for a variety of club meetings, events, and announcements</li>
<li>Designed posters and programs for our Fall and Spring shows during the academic year</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a strong supporter of &quot;casual professionalism&quot; and using tight, non-condescending language to reach and connect with an audience. I have an ear for both what is hip on social media and what would sound embarrassing coming from a corporate account rather than a person. I also have an understanding of social media trends and how to write snappy, eye-catching marketing copy.</p>
<p>You can find examples of my work below. However, if you want to hear more about my work, reach out! I'm always happy to talk about my projects.</p>
