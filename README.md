# wwwwill
A personal website, located at [wwwill.org](wwwill.org).

<!-- I'm working on learning web development to create a website for myself. The site in its most basic state should have three main features: a place to showcase my games, a place to showcase my music, and a blog. I may add more features if I feel ambitious, and I'll continue to update and polish the website as I get more comfortable with web dev. -->

<!-- I'm using Eleventy as a framework to generate the site. All other content is my own, unless otherwise specified. -->

Working on getting another type of website gen up and running. We'll see if it works.
