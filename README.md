# WWWill
Still need to check whether or not the name "wwwill.org" is taken. Surely it is.

I'm working on web development to create a website for myself. The site should have three main features: a place to showcase my games, a place to showcase my music, and a blog. I may add more features if I feel ambitious.

I'm using Eleventy as a framework to generate the site. All other content is my own, unless otherwise specified.
