Welcome to Will Kibel's website.

This website is a WORK IN PROGRESS. More updates will be coming soon.

### How it's going so far
Web dev is a daunting thing to get into. I have little to no experience with it right now, and I worry about whether I'll be able to get this project off the ground or not. I'm not exactly a great developer, but I'm hopeful that if I commit to it, I can get this project up and running, and not just have a functional website but _understand_ how I got there in the first place.

I'm starting slow, just trying to learn the basics of how Markdown works (not that it's all that involved, but it's still something I need to get used to).

My next step, I think, is twofold - get CSS working (so the site looks nicer), and get links working (so I can have multiple pages and navigate through them). Those are both top priorities right now.

I'm not sure how the formatting is going to work  
with CSS and everything, but for now I suppose  
I can just try to make things aligned right myself
