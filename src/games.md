Sometimes, I make games. This page is under construction idk

I have experience with many facets of the development process, including design, programming, writing, audio, marketing, and production. I'm trained in Agile/Scrum workflows (I've used quite a bit of Jira) and I pride myself on being organized and not blocking other people's work. I've taken classes in both level design and narrative design, and I've designed for tabletop games and board games as well as video games. I've also been known to both DM and play a few DnD campaigns from time to time.

If you're interested in my programming abilities, you can find some more of my work (including the source code for this very website) on my [Github](https://github.com/willkbl). And if you'd like a more full account of my skills or want to see something specific, please reach out to me! I'm always happy to discuss my work or provide something further.
