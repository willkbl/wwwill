One of my areas of specialty is marketing, with a focus in copywriting and social media management. I spent 6 months as a Marketing Intern at Akupara Games, as well as a year as the head of marketing for the Northeastern Shakespeare Society.

Here's what I've done:
#### Akupara Games - Marketing Intern (June - December 2025)
- Managed 4 social media accounts, both broad company accounts and accounts for specific games
- Wrote copy for 12+ different games from the Akupara catalog
- Coordinated synchronized posts across multiple platforms (Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, GameJolt and Threads)
- Spearheaded multiple social media initiatives, including takeovers, shoutouts, video clips, and content calendars
- Created assets for use for social media promotion
- Credited on several Akupara-published games, including _Rain World_, _Airframe Ultra_, _GIGASWORD_, _Echo Weaver_, _Montabi_, _Dead Pets Unleashed_, and _Future Vibe Check_
