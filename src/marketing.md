One of my areas of specialty is marketing, with a focus in copywriting and social media management. I spent 6 months as a Marketing Intern at [Akupara Games](https://www.akuparagames.com/), as well as a year as the Head of Marketing for the [Northeastern Shakespeare Society](https://www.instagram.com/shakespearenu).

Here's what I've done:
#### Akupara Games - Marketing Intern (June - December 2025)
- Managed 4 social media accounts, both broad company accounts and accounts for specific games
- Wrote copy for over 200 posts for 12+ different games from the Akupara catalog
- Coordinated synchronized posts across multiple platforms (Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, LinkedIn, GameJolt and Threads)
- Spearheaded multiple social media initiatives, including takeovers, shoutouts, video clips, and content calendars
- Created assets for use for social media promotion
- Credited on several Akupara-published games, including [_Rain World_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/), [_Airframe Ultra_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2522120/Airframe_Ultra/), [_GIGASWORD_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885930/GIGASWORD/), [_Echo Weaver_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184080/Echo_Weaver/), [_Montabi_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141630/Montabi/), [_Dead Pets Unleashed_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851720/Dead_Pets_Unleashed/), and [_Future Vibe Check_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525890/Future_Vibe_Check/)


#### Northeastern Shakespeare Society (April 2024 - April 2025)
- Upheld our social media accounts/links and helped facilitate auditions, signups, and events
- Made graphics for a variety of club meetings, events, and announcements 
- Designed posters and programs for our Fall and Spring shows during the academic year

I am a strong supporter of "casual professionalism" and using tight, non-condescending language to reach and connect with an audience. I have an ear for both what is hip on social media and what would sound embarrassing coming from a corporate account rather than a person. I also have an understanding of social media trends and how to write snappy, eye-catching marketing copy.

You can find examples of my work below. However, if you want to hear more about my work, reach out! I'm always happy to talk about my projects.
