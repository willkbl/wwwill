Trains emerge from the concrete pillars, stretching over the countryside and into the waves, orange and turquoise streaks fading into some unknown future.

The year is 2056. They have drained the color from the ocean.

The year is 2056. The trains run long, near infinite. The tracks are rusty. The world is groaning.

Dani knows her hoverboard like a new friend. She runs her fingers over its edge, the curved, polished plastic thrumming, the rhythmic feedback of the repulsors. It’s textured, yet smooth. Calculated pockmarks, not an acne but a deliberate collection of miniature craters. Not scars, but points on a constellation.

Some hoverboards are quiet. Not Dani’s. Her board sputters and growls.

She is seated on a hard, concrete bench outside a courthouse. The sun is hidden behind a skyscraper. Long, dim shadows pattern the road in front of her, which little vehicles scuttle across aimlessly.

The board rests upright, repulsors only doing enough work to keep it vertical. Dani lays a hand on it gently, keeping it stationary in as unrestrictive a way as possible. She spins it, aimlessly.

The streetlight beep in sequence. They didn’t use to make noise, but changing traffic laws and the prevalence of open-air transportation has resulted in climbing accident rates, making it a statistical necessity.
